# Pyvolve
Pyvolve is a simple natural simulation which is designed to showcase the effects of different conditions on a population, through a process known as natural selection.
ControlSimulation.py only displays the Births, and deaths of the current generation, as well as the population.
ControlSimulationAlternate.py prints out every creature immediately after it has been generated.
Pyvolve.py is the full program, with all features implemented, and then some. It currently has no generation limit, and a TOGGLEABLE Periodic Genome display.
